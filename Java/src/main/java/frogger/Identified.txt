Single Responsibility Principle Violation: The Frogger class is handling too much
responsibility. It manages frog movement, holds player information (like name,
phone number, etc.), and interacts directly with the Road class to check for
obstacles. This blends gameplay logic with player data management, which should
ideally be separated.

High Coupling: The Frogger class directly accesses the Road class's internal state
(occupied array) to check if a position is occupied or valid. This design tightly
couples the Frogger class to the Road class's implementation, making future changes
to Road potentially problematic for Frogger.

Refactoring

For Single Responsibility Principle:

Separate Player Information: Create a separate class for managing player information,
like PlayerProfile or PlayerRecord, which would encapsulate attributes such as firstName,
lastName, phoneNumber, zipCode, state, and gender. The Frogger class would then have a 
reference to a PlayerProfile object instead of holding all these fields directly.

public class PlayerProfile {
    private String firstName, lastName, phoneNumber, zipCode, state, gender;
    
    // Constructor, getters, and setters
}

Frogger Class Simplification: Simplify the Frogger class to focus solely on the
gameplay aspect, like moving the frog and interacting with the game environment.

For Reducing Coupling:

Encapsulation of Road Logic: Instead of exposing the occupied array directly through
a getOccupied method, provide more abstract operations within the Road class, such as
isOccupied(int position) and isValidPosition(int position). This way, Frogger interacts
with Road through these abstract operations, reducing the dependency on the internal
representation of Road.

public class Road {
    private final boolean[] occupied;

    public Road(boolean[] occupied) {
        this.occupied = occupied;
    }
    
    public boolean isOccupied(int position) {
        return occupied[position];
    }
    
    public boolean isValidPosition(int position) {
        return position >= 0 && position < occupied.length;
    }
}

Updating Frogger Class: Modify the Frogger class to use these new methods from Road,
thus adhering to the principle of least knowledge (or law of Demeter), where it only talks
to its direct friends.

public boolean move(boolean forward) {
    int nextPosition = this.position + (forward ? 1 : -1);
    if (!road.isValidPosition(nextPosition) || road.isOccupied(nextPosition)) {
        return false;
    }
    this.position = nextPosition;
    return true;
}


second issue:

The design problem related to the Frogger class recording itself via the recordMyself method
involves a violation of the single responsibility principle (SRP) and potentially an
inappropriate intimacy antipattern. The Frogger class, which primarily should be concerned
with game logic (e.g., moving the frog across the road), is also managing the recording of
player data into some form of records system. This dual responsibility complicates the
Frogger class and couples it tightly with the Records system, which might be more about
data persistence or player progress tracking.

Design Problem

    Single Responsibility Principle Violation: The Frogger class is responsible for both
    gameplay mechanics and data persistence (recording player data). This makes the class
    less cohesive and more difficult to maintain or extend.
    Inappropriate Intimacy: The Frogger class directly interacts with the Records class to
    record player data. This might not be an issue if the interaction is simple, but it does
    suggest that Frogger knows too much about how records are managed, stored, or structured.

Proposed Refactoring

To address these issues, the responsibilities of recording player data should be decoupled
from the Frogger class. This can be achieved by introducing a new class that handles player
data recording or by adjusting the responsibilities between Frogger and Records to better
align with SRP.
Introduce a PlayerDataService or similar

A new class, PlayerDataService, could be introduced to act as an intermediary between
Frogger and Records. This service would be responsible for taking player data from Frogger
and recording it in Records.

This adjustment means that Frogger no longer needs to know about how to record itself,
making it more focused on game logic. The PlayerDataService becomes the single point of
interaction with the Records, isolating changes to player data recording from affecting
the Frogger class.

Conclusion

By introducing a dedicated service for handling player data recording, or by reorganizing
responsibilities so that Frogger does not directly manage its recording, the design becomes
cleaner and adheres more closely to the single responsibility principle. This separation of
concerns improves the modularity and maintainability of the code, making it easier to adapt
or extend in the future.
