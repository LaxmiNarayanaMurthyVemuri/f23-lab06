Single Responsibility Principle Violation: The Frogger class is handling too much
responsibility. It manages frog movement, holds player information (like name,
phone number, etc.), and interacts directly with the Road class to check for
obstacles. This blends gameplay logic with player data management, which should
ideally be separated.

High Coupling: The Frogger class directly accesses the Road class's internal state
(occupied array) to check if a position is occupied or valid. This design tightly
couples the Frogger class to the Road class's implementation, making future changes
to Road potentially problematic for Frogger.

Refactoring

For Single Responsibility Principle:

Separate Player Information: Create a separate class for managing player information,
like PlayerProfile or PlayerRecord, which would encapsulate attributes such as firstName,
lastName, phoneNumber, zipCode, state, and gender. The Frogger class would then have a 
reference to a PlayerProfile object instead of holding all these fields directly.

public class PlayerProfile {
    private String firstName, lastName, phoneNumber, zipCode, state, gender;
    
    // Constructor, getters, and setters
}

Frogger Class Simplification: Simplify the Frogger class to focus solely on the
gameplay aspect, like moving the frog and interacting with the game environment.

For Reducing Coupling:

Encapsulation of Road Logic: Instead of exposing the occupied array directly through
a getOccupied method, provide more abstract operations within the Road class, such as
isOccupied(int position) and isValidPosition(int position). This way, Frogger interacts
with Road through these abstract operations, reducing the dependency on the internal
representation of Road.

public class Road {
    private final boolean[] occupied;

    public Road(boolean[] occupied) {
        this.occupied = occupied;
    }
    
    public boolean isOccupied(int position) {
        return occupied[position];
    }
    
    public boolean isValidPosition(int position) {
        return position >= 0 && position < occupied.length;
    }
}

Updating Frogger Class: Modify the Frogger class to use these new methods from Road,
thus adhering to the principle of least knowledge (or law of Demeter), where it only talks
to its direct friends.

public boolean move(boolean forward) {
    int nextPosition = this.position + (forward ? 1 : -1);
    if (!road.isValidPosition(nextPosition) || road.isOccupied(nextPosition)) {
        return false;
    }
    this.position = nextPosition;
    return true;
}
